#tag-test

A web based markdown viewer optimized for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Notes

Just put your whole Obsidian vault or markdown folder/file structure in your web directory. The page builds itself. 

It's an open source alternative to [Obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish).

Read more about Perlite and staging tips on my blog post: [Perlite on Secure77](https://secure77.de/perlite).
